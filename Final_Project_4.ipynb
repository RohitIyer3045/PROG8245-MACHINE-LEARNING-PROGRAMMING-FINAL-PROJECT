         "Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I \"solved\" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...<br /><br />Second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? Is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your \"friend with benefits\", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed \"drama\".<br /><br />And I won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey's Anatomy... On a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, PhD or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle? Apart from that little fling with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one...",

         "Riget II is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one. This series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one. There are much more comedy in this, good one, though.<br /><br />We're back at the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done, but fate want's it otherwise. She is soon chasing ghosts and Helmer is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the Kingdom.<br /><br />This story involves a lot more comedy that the previous. By all means lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. The story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just kind of silly, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and thrilling as the first series.<br /><br />The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's an odd story and setting. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job. Yet, these actors handle this whole situation perfectly.<br /><br />Much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact. The cinematography is one of those qualities. The hand-held camera that made Trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier makes use of these abilities. Good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first. Also be prepared to see some more. I didn't think that green thing looked all too good. Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit. Never the less, the effects like the ghosts are really good. The non-digital effects looks good too. Little Brother looks just really odd, but you accept it. All over I'd say effects are from OK to good.<br /><br />The music is also quite good. Moody and nice. Some of it are really touching. It fits really nice. As the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well.<br /><br />All together this makes a good sequel. If you'd seen Riget you can see this one without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two makes up a series you don't wanna miss.",

Anyone who has ever served time in the US military can see how bogus this film is. Uniforms, equipment, sets, and mannerisms are all wrong.

Most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years. Uses every cliche', rumor, and Urban Legend from the Gulf-all are presented as gospel. (The truth is, no one knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new.

         "Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I \"solved\" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...<br /><br />Second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? Is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your \"friend with benefits\", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed \"drama\".<br /><br />And I won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey's Anatomy... On a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, PhD or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle? Apart from that little fling with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other.

         "Riget II is a good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one. This series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one. There are much more comedy in this, good one, though.<br /><br />We're back at the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done, but fate want's it otherwise. She is soon chasing ghosts and Helmer is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the Kingdom.<br /><br />This story involves a lot more comedy that the previous. By all means lot of fun, but it makes you take the series a little less serious. The story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just kind of silly, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and thrilling as the first series.<br /><br />The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast. They are all very good. It's an odd story and setting. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job. Yet, these actors handle this whole situation perfectly.<br /><br />Much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact. The cinematography is one of those qualities. The hand-held camera that made Trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier makes use of these abilities. Good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first. Also be prepared to see some more. I didn't think that green thing looked all too good. Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit. Never the less, the effects like the ghosts are really good. The non-digital effects looks good too. Little Brother looks just really odd, but you accept it. All over I'd say effects are from OK to good.<br /><br />The music is also quite good. Moody and nice. Some of it are really touching. It fits really nice. As the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well.<br /><br />All together this makes a good sequel. If you'd seen Riget you can see this one without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two makes up a series you don't wanna miss.",

Anyone who has ever served time in the US military can see how bogus this film is. Uniforms, equipment, sets, and mannerisms are all wrong.

Most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years. Uses every cliche', rumor, and Urban Legend from the Gulf-all are presented as gospel. (The truth is, no one knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new.

    "The model produced the following confusion matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                |Predicted Positive   |\tPredicted Negative |\n",
    "|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "|Actual Positive | 200 | 50 |\n",
    "|Actual Negative | 33 |\t217 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This table allows us to evaluate how well the model distinguishes positive and negative movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Model Correctly Classified 200 Positive Reviews (True Positives)\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier successfully identified 200 actual positive reviews as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the model:\n",
    " - Recognizes strong positive sentiment words\n",
    " - Performs well when reviews contain clear praise or positive expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Model Correctly Classified 217 Negative Reviews (True Negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "True Negatives represent correct detection of negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests the model is:\n",
    " - Good at identifying dissatisfaction or criticism\n",
    " - Sensitive to negative-intensity terms like boring, terrible, awful, disappointing\n",
    " - Effective at capturing negative sentiment patterns in TF-IDF features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important strength, especially for applications like review moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Model Produced 50 False Negatives (FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Actual Positive → Predicted Negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "False Negatives: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "These reviews expressed positive sentiment, but the model labeled them as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this happens:\n",
    " - The positive language may be subtle\n",
    " - Reviews may contain mixed content (positive opinion + negative plot elements)\n",
    " - Naive Bayes tends to lean conservative when evidence is ambiguous\n",
    " - The review may use sarcasm or nuanced tone (very challenging for NB)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common weakness in sentiment models, as positive sentiment is often expressed more subtly than negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Model Produced 33 False Positives (FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Actual Negative → Predicted Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "False Positives: 33\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative reviews incorrectly labeled as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this happens:\n",
    " - Negative reviews may contain positive words describing plot elements, not sentiment\n",
    "e.g., “The acting was good, but the story was terrible.”\n",
    " - TF-IDF does not understand sentence structure or sarcasm\n",
    " - Naive Bayes assumes word independence—so the presence of positive words may mislead it\n",
    "\n",
    "False positives are slightly lower than false negatives, suggesting the model is more cautious about predicting positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Appears Better at Identifying Negative Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing accuracy by class:\n",
    "- **Positive review accuracy:**\n",
    "TP / (TP + FN) = 200 / 250 = 80%\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative review accuracy:**\n",
    "TN / (TN + FP) = 217 / 250 = 86.8%\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the model is better at detecting negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative sentiment tends to use strong, direct emotional words:\n",
    "terrible, waste, horrible, awful\n",
    "Positive sentiment can be more nuanced, which Naive Bayes struggles with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall,The confusion matrix reveals that:\n",
    " - The Naive Bayes classifier provides a solid baseline\n",
    " - Accuracy is reasonably high\n",
    " - However, there is room for improvement in detecting positive sentiment\n",
    "- Techniques like SVD + Logistic Regression can often reduce false negatives significantly\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets the stage for the next steps in the project—dimensionality reduction and more advanced classification "

    " - The classifier is relatively cautious—not over-predicting positivity\n",
    " - False positives (negative reviews predicted as positive) are relatively low\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with the confusion matrix, where FP = 33 is lower than FN = 50.\n",

    "Recall measures how many of the actual positive reviews the model successfully identifies.\n",

    "A value of 0.8000 implies:\n",
    " - The model captures 80% of all positive reviews\n",
    " - It misses 20% of them (False Negatives)\n",
    " - The classifier is more conservative in marking sentiment as positive\n",
    "\n",
    "This imbalance (Precision > Recall) indicates that Naive Bayes:\n",

    " - F1-score : 0.84\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is very effective at identifying negative reviews\n",
    "- High recall suggests it rarely misses negative sentiment\n",
    "- Negative reviews often contain stronger emotional language, making them easier for TF-IDF + Naive Bayes to detect\n",

    "Positive Class\n",
    " - Precision : 0.86\n",
    " - Recall : 0.80\n",
    " - F1-score : 0.83\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is accurate when predicting positivity\n",
    "- But recall is lower because many positive reviews are misclassified as negative\n",
    "- This matches the 50 false negatives observed earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Macro and Weighted Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Macro avg F1 = 0.83\n",
    "- Weighted avg F1 = 0.83\n",
    "\n",
    "These nearly identical values indicate:\n",
    " - Balanced class distribution\n",
    " - Similar performance across both classes\n",
    " - No class receives disproportionately better or worse treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an indication of a well-behaved classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes model performs very well as a baseline, but:\n",
    " - It tends to be conservative in predicting positivity\n",
    " - It excels at identifying negative sentiment\n",
    " - It can be improved by more powerful models such as Logistic Regression with SVD or PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets a strong foundation for the dimensionality reduction and advanced modeling steps that follow."

    "### STEP 4: Dimensionality Reduction with SVD (Latent Semantic Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "-As the next step, we will apply Truncated SVD (a technique used in Latent Semantic Analysis) to further reduce the dimensions of the TF-IDF feature matrix. At this stage, we will compress the TF-IDF features that consist of thousands of dimensions to the semantic feature space of about 100 dimensions. \n",

It is expected that the latent variables will be able to cluster words that have the same meaning, used in the same contexts, or captured in the same algebraic form so that the latent variables will be able to form a lower dimensional space which is much more efficient in representing the reviews. We will be increasingly interested in visualizing the explained variance ratio to understand how much information is captured in each SVD component.\n",

    "By running the above code, we get an output that includes both the original dimensions for our TF-IDF Matrix and the dimensions of the same matrix after applying SVD. For example, let's say our TF-IDF Matrix has a shape of (37500, 5000) - which means we have 37,500 training reviews and a vocabulary size of 5000 unique words. After applying SVD, we get a shape of (37500, 100). In this example, this means that instead of each review being represented with 5000 different TF-IDF features, the review is now represented with 100 latent features. Below is a printout of some explained variance values:\n",

    "### How SVD Captures Semantic Relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncated SVD (LSA) doesn’t just reduce dimensions arbitrarily – it finds latent semantic factors in the data. Each SVD component is a linear combination of the original TF-IDF features (words) and is chosen to capture as much variance as possible. In the context of text, this means each component tends to represent a certain topic or concept across the documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Words that often appear together in reviews (or in similar contexts) will have correlated TF-IDF values, and SVD will combine such groups of words into one latent component. For example, terms like “film, movie, director” might load heavily on one component (perhaps representing a movie production theme), whereas words like “scary, creepy, horror” might load on another component (a horror theme).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, synonymous or related terms (e.g., “excellent” and “fantastic”, or “bad” and “terrible”) that convey the same idea tend to contribute to the same components. This is how SVD captures semantic similarity: even if two reviews use different words, if those words are used in similar contexts or indicate similar sentiment, the SVD representation of those reviews will be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each document (review) is also transformed into this latent semantic space. So a review’s SVD features tell us how much that review aligns with each latent topic. For instance, a strongly positive review might have a high value on a component that corresponds to positive sentiment-related words, regardless of whether it used the exact word “positive” or specific synonyms.\n"

    "In summary, we’ve compressed and expressed the text data in our TF-IDF by using an SVD decomposition, creating a lot fewer dimensions but also helping to highlight the underlying semantic structure of the text. Our model will now be training on fewer features which represent “broader ideas” (topics, sentiments, etc) in the reviews instead of thousands of specific word counts. This can help our modeling in a few ways by pruning out noise (less important words/dimensions) as well as grouping synonymous features together. This typically leads to more generalizable features. In the next section, we’ll use the 100D SVD features to train on a classifier and see how they compare!"

    "### Step 5: Model Training - Logistic Regression with SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we apply Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of the TF-IDF feature matrix, and then train a Logistic Regression classifier on the reduced features. Truncated SVD (also known as Latent Semantic Analysis, LSA) is well-suited for text data because it does not require mean-centering and can efficiently handle sparse TF-IDF matrices.\n",

We then transform the text reviews into TF-IDF features (using a predefined vocabulary size for manageability and removing common stop words). Next, we perform Truncated SVD on the training TF-IDF matrix to obtain 100 latent components, and project both the training and test data into this 100-dimensional space. Finally, we train a logistic regression model on the 100-dimensional training data and evaluate it on the test set, computing the confusion matrix and key performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)."

    "These results show the logistic regression model with 100 SVD-derived features performs quite well on the sentiment classification task. Importantly, it slightly outperforms the Naive Bayes baseline-in terms of accuracy and F1-score-which had been running at around 84.5% accuracy in earlier steps. This would suggest that reducing the sparse TF-IDF matrix to a dense semantic space via SVD has captured important latent topics or correlations between words, enabling the logistic regression to make more informed decisions. The logistic model likely benefits from these compressed features by avoiding overfitting to spurious high-dimensional patterns and focusing on the most significant semantic components of the data."

The baseline confusion matrix (not shown here) had slightly higher misclassification counts (e.g. over 1000 false positives and ~900 false negatives), leading to a lower F1-score (~0.847). \n",

    "-The SVD-based model's improvement in both precision and recall indicates that dimensionality reduction did not hurt performance — in fact, it helped the model generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Another benefit of using SVD is that it dramatically reduces the feature space dimensionality (from potentially tens of thousands of TF-IDF features down to 100). This reduction can lead to faster model training and prediction times and lower memory usage. In our case, the logistic regression model trains faster on the 100-dimensional dense data than it would on the full sparse TF-IDF matrix."
